## Rhino Hunt Lab
This lab can be found [here](https://cfreds-archive.nist.gov/dfrws/Rhino_Hunt.html) and was used as a forensics exercise. The final document was compiled using groff. This was my first attempt at using groff to format documents. For related groff files, including the source for this write-up, please visit my groff [repo](https://github.com/c-Shott/Groffwork).
