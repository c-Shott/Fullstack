## Rhino Hunt Lab
This lab can be found [here](https://cfreds-archive.nist.gov/dfrws/Rhino_Hunt.html) and was used as a forensics exercise. The final document was compiled using groff. This writeup was my first attempt at using groff to format and generate documents. For the source file and related groff things, please check out my groff [repo](https://github.com/c-Shott/Grofwork)
